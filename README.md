# How to run

1. Git clone
2. Type `npm install` in your terminal
3. Then run `npm start` command

For this home task I used create-react-app builder with typescrypt preset.
Also I added sass loader for the scss files processing.

If you don't want to run the project locally - you can visit [https://ts-autocomplete.vercel.app/](https://ts-autocomplete.vercel.app/) url for testing.

Thanks!
